          <p>Tues,Nov 29,2016</p>
          <div>JSON is built on two structures: A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array. An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.</div>

          <div>While there are all sorts of resources people use when learning to code — screencasts, videos, books, tutorials, online courses, and more— in this article I will only focus on some of the best and most popular interactive websites that have you learn by solving challenges or building projects online. While most online resources do have some interactive tests or challenges you can take that allows you to actually code, some focus heavily on having you practice which I believe is the best way to get better at coding.></div>

          <p>Tues,Nov,29,2016</p>
          <div>Networks can be beautiful and complex with the only use of routers and switches. However, a network made of just routers and switches is completely useless. In fact, the purpose of any network is to move data from some devices to some others. Without end-devices actually sourcing traffic, a network doesn’t make much sense. Adding real servers in your lab might be expensive, but not today. With GNS3, you can add all the virtual servers you’d like. In this lab, we will explain how to do that: connecting VMs in GNS3.</div>

          <p>Tues,Nov,29,2016</p>
          <div>Improve existing skills
              Whether it’s coding, user interface design, graphic design, writing, or organizing, if you’re looking for practice, there’s a task for you on an open source project.
              
              Meet people who are interested in similar things
              Open source projects with warm, welcoming communities keep people coming back for years. Many people form lifelong friendships through their participation in open source, whether it’s running into each other at conferences or late night online chats about burritos.
              
              Find mentors and teach others
              Working with others on a shared project means you’ll have to explain how you do things, as well as ask other people for help. The acts of learning and teaching can be a fulfilling activity for everyone involved.
              
              Build public artifacts that help you grow a reputation (and a career)
              By definition, all of your open source work is public, which means you get free examples to take anywhere as a demonstration of what you can do.
              
              Learn people skills
              Open source offers opportunities to practice leadership and management skills, such as resolving conflicts, organizing teams of people, and prioritizing work.
              
              It’s empowering to be able to make changes, even small ones
              You don’t have to become a lifelong contributor to enjoy participating in open source. Have you ever seen a typo on a website, and wished someone would fix it? On an open source project, you can do just that. Open source helps people feel agency over their lives and how they experience the world, and that in itself is gratifying.</div>

              <p>Tues,Nov,29,2016</p>
              <div>
                  Are there any good thing, best practice or profit we have after using the HTML helper in an ASP.NET MVC project?
                  
                  When I am trying to use them I found that I lose the speed I have with HTML and many difficulties I have whenever I use an HTML helper.
                  
                  Other [non-techie] persons can't understand what I write using Helper if I want to show them or they want to do something they need to spent more time on, even if they have working knowledge of HTML.
                  
                  If I use an HTML helper I lose the speed. When I use HTML I just type and of course I am not aware of it. But using helper, it is hard to understand.
                  
                  What thing do we get when I use HTML helper? I think it is nothing I get because I lose the speeed. Others can't understand what I do using helper and can't customize the code if they want.
                  
                  Why do we use HTML helpers?</div>
